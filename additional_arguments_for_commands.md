# Additional Arguments
### Every command has additional arguments, and they may or may not overlap in meaning, here are some that are *possibly* universal.
### Also don't forget you can combine addition arguments in changes, for instance, if you wanted a long form list of human readable files that contained hidden files `ls -lah` would do that for you.

`man` - Manual (search for commands)
`-l` - Long
`-a` or `--all` - All
`--help` or `-h` or `-?` - Help
`-v` or `--verbose` - Explicitly explain what is happening
`--version` - The version of the software/program
`-r` or `-R`, `--recursive` - Adds recursion, used for things like deleting directories
`-d` or `--directory` - Directory, in `ls -d` would list directory names, not content
`-h` or `--human-readable` - Has echo to be human readable
`-y` - Yes, usually means yes to all prompts
